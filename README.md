# IconGen
This simple application will generate the image files needed for the icons for IPhone, IPad and Android.  

It's very basic and just outputs a set of images based on a selected image. 

It uses Fody (https://github.com/Fody/Fody),PropertyChanged.Fody(https://github.com/Fody/PropertyChanged) and ImageProcessor (http://imageprocessor.org/).
